\section{First results/draft}

(8 epochs, sampled dataset, local cpu run, so far)
The constrained autoencoder (CAE) successfully learned to align the latent embedding space with the semantic attribute
space, achieving an NMI of 0.75 and a silhouette score of 0.43 on the AwA2 sample. These results confirm that
integrating symbolic predicate supervision enhances semantic consistency and cluster separability without direct
access to class labels.
