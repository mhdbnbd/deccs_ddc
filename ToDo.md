# Thesis Development Plan

## 1. Methodology Development

### Design the Integrated Algorithm
- **DECCS Implementation**: Implement or adapt the DECCS algorithm using an autoencoder to learn consensus representations.
- **DDC Integration**: Develop methods to incorporate symbolic-level representations from DDC into DECCS.
- **Algorithm Testing**: Create a testing framework to evaluate the integrated algorithm on AwA and aPY datasets.

## 2. Data Preparation

### AwA and aPY Datasets
- **Data Collection**: Ensure access to the Animals with Attributes (AwA) and aPascal & aYahoo (aPY) datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the datasets for clustering, including normalization, handling missing values, and feature extraction.

## 3. Experimentation Plan

### Design Your Experiments
- **Performance Metrics**: Define metrics for evaluating clustering performance (e.g., Normalized Mutual Information, Adjusted Rand Index) and interpretability.
- **Experimental Setup**: Plan the experiments to compare DECCS, DDC, and the integrated approach on the datasets.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Determine the hyperparameters for the algorithms and their optimization methods.

## 4. Implementation

### Coding
- **Algorithm Development**: Start coding the DECCS algorithm and integrate DDC. Use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning components.
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Write scripts to evaluate clustering performance and interpretability.

## 5. Iterative Refinement

### Testing and Refinement
- **Run Experiments**: Execute your experiments and collect results.
- **Analyze Results**: Analyze the results to determine if the integrated approach meets the objectives.
- **Refinement**: Refine your approach based on the experimental outcomes.
