# Thesis Development Plan

## 0. Research and literature review

- review seminar feedbacks
- fix citations and references
- shorten abstract
- include tables
- proofread
- recheck recently published literature 

## 1. Methodology

### Design the Integrated Algorithm
- **DECCS Implementation**: Implement or adapt the DECCS algorithm using an autoencoder to learn consensus representations.
- **DDC Integration**: Develop methods to incorporate symbolic-level representations from DDC into DECCS.
- **Algorithm Testing**: Create a testing experiments to evaluate the integrated algorithm on AwA and aPY datasets.

## 2. Data Preparation

### AwA and aPY Datasets
- **Data Collection**: describe the Animals with Attributes (AwA) and aPascal & aYahoo (aPY) datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: describe the followed preprocessing method including normalization, handling missing values, and feature extraction.

## 3. Experimentation 

### Design Your Experiments
- **Performance Metrics**: Define metrics for evaluating clustering performance (e.g., Normalized Mutual Information, Adjusted Rand Index) and interpretability.
- **Experimental Setup**: Plan the experiments to compare DECCS, DDC, and the integrated approach on the datasets.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Determine the hyperparameters for the algorithms and their optimization methods.


## 4. Iterative Refinement

### Testing and Refinement, update dcocumentation after each refinement
- **Run Experiments**: Execute experiments and collect results.
- **Analyze Results**: Analyze the results to determine if the integrated approach meets the objectives.
- **Refinement**: Refine accordingly.
